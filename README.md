# ParkingGarage
Class assignment to make a parking gargage.
By Jessica Rinks and Apollo Johnson.

We operate a tiny parking garage which has three spaces, but our garage is very popular because it allows customers to name their own price!  

We created this parking garage program using Object Oriented Programming. Our program starts by creating an instance of the class Garage() which is a customer class that contains two lists, one for tickets available and one for spaces available,  and one dictionary which stores informaiton about tickets currently in use.  When a user approaches the ticket station, the main() driver program is activated.  We ask for user input to determine if they want to take a new ticket or pay for an existing ticket. Based on their answer, the program checks to see if there are any available spaces in the garage and then--if there are available espaces--calls to one of thwo class methods: garage.take_ticket or garage.pay_ticket.
